## Abstract: 

Keywords: 1815 Tambora eruption, lake sediments, varve thickness, climate event

## 1. Introduction: 

A proper understanding of past climate states is crucial for contextualizing current climate change and indispensable for making future climate projections more precise (ref tierney et al 2020). Although increasingly accurate, climate reconstructions still require improvements to limit existing uncertainties and contribute to further advances in paleoclimate research. One avenue proposed to obtain more precise inferences of past climate states is a better understanding of the climate signals in proxy data derived from climatic archives (Kaufman and Broadman, 2023 ref). 

There are numerous archives that serve as important sources of paleoclimatic information. Varve, or annually laminated, lake sediments are unique among them by providing precisely dated, annually resolved, continuous records from the terrestrial realm that can extend millennia into the past and cover a wide range of climate variables (Zolitschka et al., 2015). Various approaches have been used to reconstruct climate from varve sediments. Perhaps the simplest yet very efficient approach relies on varve or varve sublayer thickness measurements. The obtained thickness time series often reveal strong relationships with instrumentally measured climate variables (e.g., Bird et al., 2008; Thomas and Briner, 2008; Vegas-Vilarrúbia et al., 2022), and it is this strong relationship that usually serves as a basis for inferring past climates beyond the coverage of instrumental data.

The climate-varve/varve sublayer thickness relationship results from direct and indirect influences of climate on processes controlling the accumulation of authigenic and allogenic sediment components at lake bottoms. This relationship is site-specific, as sedimentation in lakes is governed by multiple local-scale factors that modify the original climate signal (ref. Fritz, 2007). Consequently, fluctuations in various varve/varve sublayer thickness records can be explained by different climate variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind speed) and seasons (ref. Zolitschka et al., 2015). One therefore needs to understand each sedimentary system separately to properly derive climatic information from the thickness time series.

The ability of varve/varve sublayer thickness records to provide reliable inferences of past climate fluctuations over decades, centuries, and millennia is generally well-established. However, the suitability of this proxy for reconstructing yearly-scale climate events has not, to our knowledge, been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, it remains to be confirmed whether exceptional short-term temperature or precipitation shifts correspond to anomalous thicknesses. We argue that one way to verify the potential of varve/varve sublayer thicknesses to record short-term climate events is to examine thickness anomalies corresponding to prominent climate cooling events following major volcanic eruptions (ref. Cooper et al., 2018).

Multiple volcanic eruptions over the last millennium have significantly influenced global climate, as revealed by comprehensive evaluations based on tree-ring records (ref. Sigl et al., 2015). These events, known as volcanic winters, typically last from one to three years and are caused by the formation of sulfuric acid aerosols in the stratosphere following eruptions, which enhance the scattering of incoming solar radiation (ref. Cooper et al., 2018). Among these events, the 1816 CE 'Year Without a Summer' (YWS) associated with the 1815 eruption of the Indonesian volcano Tambora, is perhaps the most suitable for examining the potential of varve/varve sublayer thicknesses to record short-term climate events for several reasons.

Firstly, YWS was one of the most severe volcanic winters in recent millennia (ref. Sigl et al., 2015) and globally the second coldest year in over 300 years (ref. Neukom et al., 2019), meeting the criterion of prominence. Secondly, the Year Without a Summer is well-documented in various sources, including historical documents and proxy data (ref. Brönnimann, 2014), allowing for a comprehensive understanding of both the magnitude and geographical extent of the climatic changes. Thirdly, because the event is relatively recent, varve chronologies are expected to suffer minimally from counting errors, enabling precise correlation of the event with thickness anomalies. Lastly, there is a relatively large number of varve/varve sublayer records from various geographic settings covering the time of the event (ref. Ramish et al.), which facilitates obtaining replicable results.

In this study, we examined published varve/varve sublayer thickness records covering the last ~250 years or more, along with available climate anomaly data for the YWS. Our aim was to identify significant varve thickness anomalies in the records around 1816 and evaluate their possible links to the YWS climate event. Given the confirmed sensitivity of varve/varve sublayer thicknesses to climate fluctuations and the prominence of the climate anomaly, we hypothesized that the YWS correlates commonly with noticeable thickness anomalies in the records. 

## 2. Methods 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
full_ds <- read_csv("data/full_ds.csv") %>% 
  filter(age_CE >= 1766 & age_CE <= 1866)

full_ds_distinct <- full_ds %>% 
  group_by(layer) %>% 
  distinct(lake_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

```

In this study, we relied on published varve thickness records covering the period from 1766 to 1866 CE. We focused on a 101-year-long period centered on 1816 CE, aiming to capture the prominence of anomalies potentially corresponding to YWS at a centennial scale. Only records with yearly resolution and continuity for the period in focus were included in the study. To obtain the relevant data, we searched through the following data repositories: (i) VARDA (ref. Ramisch), (ii) World Data Service for Paleoclimatology (WDS-Paleo) at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (ref. Gross), and (iii) PANGAEA (ref. Felden). Additionally, we performed a literature search for records not available in public data repositories and asked corresponding authors to make their data available for this study. If data on varve sublayer thickness was available, we used it in the analysis instead of total varve thickness values. These sublayers were assigned to two classes: “light layer” and “dark layer”. Note that these classes are descriptive and include sediments of various compositions. For four records, high-quality data was available only for a single class of varve sublayer. @tbl-list-of-records lists all the `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)` records that were examined in this study along with relevant references.

```{r kable}

table_1 <- read_csv("data/table_1.csv")

knitr::kable(table_1)
```

To identify the climate variable and season that most influence the varve or varve sublayer thicknesses in a given record, we examined the relevant information in the original publications. We described each record, distinguishing positive and negative relationships for one of the four seasons if such a relationship was reported by the authors. If the authors provided no information on the relationship, or if the relationship was reported to be weak, we classified these records as uncertain. Similarly, if no information was available on which season influenced varve thicknesses the most, or if the relationship with the seasons was uncertain, the designation was made as "NA".

Climate anomalies during the peak of the YWS for the location of the lakes were obtained from the global atmospheric paleo-reanalysis EKF400v2, which provides estimates of several climate variables with monthly resolution for the period of 1600-2005 CE (ref Valler). The paleo-reanalysis relies on a data assimilation approach that infers past climate states from both climate model simulations and observational information (documentary, instrumental, and proxy sources). Based on the EKF400v2 data, we calculated temperature anomalies for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer (June, July, August) of 1816 CE and NH winter (December, January, February) of 1816/1817 CE with respect to the 1766-1866 means. The same calculations were performed for precipitation anomalies. We focused on NH summer and winter anomalies to investigate the potential climatic effects of the 1815 CE Tambora eruption on both warm and cold seasons in both the northern and southern hemispheres. EKF400v2 performs well in describing past annual-scale climate anomalies (ref Valler), which justifies its use in this study. However, it is important to note that the precision of the reconstruction can vary depending on the proximity of the grid cell to the nearest observational information and the precision of the information itself. For the period in focus, high density and variability of information are available mainly for Europe and North America, while for most other regions, there is a shortage of information (ref Valler). This is particularly true for Africa.

To identify noticeable anomalies in varve thickness data, we first estimated trends using a running median:   
$$
MED_i =median\{x(i)\}_{i=i-k}^{i+k}
$${#eq-med}   
where $x(i)$ is the varve thickness at time $i$, and then calculated time-dependent variability in the records using a running median absolute distance:   
$$
MAD_i = median\{|x(j) - median\{x(i)\}_{i=i-k}^{i+k}|\}_{j=i-k}^{i+k}
$${#eq-mad} 
The smoothing parameter $k$, which controls width of the window in the calculations, was selected separately for each record from a range of 6 to 14 to minimize the cross-validation criterion $C_1$ prsented by Zheng and Yang (ref1998):  
$$
C_1 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n|x(i)-median\{x(j)\}_{j=i-k}^{i+k}|
$${#eq-c1}    
Limiting $k$ to the range $[6,14]$, which results in a window width of 13 to 29 years (window width = $2k + 1$), aims to avoid solutions that use either overly large or exceedingly small $k$ values. If no pre-selection is made, an erroneous $k$ an be suggested by the $C_1$ criterion, as it is not completely resistant to autocorrelation typically occurring in time series (Mudelsee_ref). We used $MED$ and $MAD$ because these are robust estimators that are not biased by extremes. Since methods relying on moving windows truncate the original records at both ends, we used records longer than 101 years as input. This approach eliminated the need to extrapolate the resulting records to obtain the desired time range of 1766-1866 CE. We consider the thickness of a layer to be anomalously large or small if it exceeds the threshold defined by
$$
MED + MAD\times z
$${#eq-tdv}  
where $z$ is a threshold detection value. Following Besonen et al. (ref2008) we examined various values of $z$. For positive anomalies, we tested zz values of 2, 3.5, and 5, while for negative anomalies, we used values of 1, 1.75, and 2.5. Lower values of $z$ were examined to detect negative extremes, considering the hard boundary at 0 mm. The final decision on selecting $z$ for positive and negative anomalies was based on evaluating the number of identified anomalies. Our aim was to identify solutions where anomalies constitute no more than 5% of all observations. For thicknesses that exceeded upper or lower thresholds, we calculated the magnitude of the anomaly considering sample-specific $MAD$:  
$$
S_m = \frac{x(i)-MED}{MAD}
$${#eq-sm}    
As a first approximation, we considered an anomaly to be potentially related to the YWS if it occurred around 1816 ± 7 years. We applied the same uncertainty level to all records because, in most cases, chronological uncertainty was not evaluated. The ±7-year range corresponds to a chronological uncertainty of 3.5% relative to the time of the YWS. This slightly exceeds the ±2% suggested by Ojala et al. (ref2012) as a realistic error for most varve chronologies. However, we decided to use a relatively long time-frame to avoid prematurely excluding anomalies around the YWS that may arise from records potentially suffering from lower chronological precision.

The records examined in this study come from `r n_of_lakes` lakes (@tbl-list-of-records). Most of the lakes are located in North America (n = `r n_continents$n[which(n_continents$continent == "North America")]`) and Europe (n = `r n_continents$n[which(n_continents$continent == "Europe")]`), but our dataset includes lakes from every continent except Australia and Antarctica (@fig-maps). The EKF400v2 reconstruction shows variable climate anomalies for the location of the lakes during NH summer 1816 and winter 1816/1817. The temperature during the summer of 1816 was noticeably lower than the average from 1766 to 1866 for most of the Earth's land surface, including the majority of the lake locations. For `r words(n_of_prominent_neg_temp_1816)` sites, the cooling exceeded 1°C reaching minimum of $\Delta$ `r round(min_temp_1816, 1)`°C at `r as.character(min_temp_1816_location)`. Warming was reported only for `r words(n_of_pos_temp_1816)` sites, but in neither case did it markedly exceed 0.5°C. During NH winter of 1816/1817 CE, more of the Earth's land surface experienced warming compared to NH summer of 1816 CE, and more lake locations showed positive temperature anomalies. However, the number of sites experiencing cooling prevailed (n = `r n_of_neg_temp_1817`). The cooling was the most pronounced for the lakes located in Arctic Canada, where it exceeded 2°C reaching a minimum of $\Delta$ `r round(min_temp_1817, 1)` °C at `r as.character(min_temp_1817_location)`. Positive anomalies exceeded 1°C at `r words(n_of_prominent_pos_temp_1817)` locations reaching a maximum of $\Delta$ `r round(max_temp_1817, 1)`°C at Lake `r as.character(max_temp_1817_location)`.

Spatial manifestation of precipitation anomalies for NH summer 1816 CE is less uniform than this of temperature anomalies. We found that exactly half of the sites (n = `r n_of_neg_prec_1816`) experienced less precipitation than the 1766-1866 CE average. Departures from the mean were mostly small (\<25%) but at Nar Gölü, there was more than twice as much precipitation as expected from the long-term mean (`r max_prec_1816`%). During NH winter 1816/1817 CE, precepitation anomalies also varied spatially. For most of the the lake locations (n = `r n_of_neg_prec_1817`), it was drier than average with the minimum of `r min_prec_1817`% of the average reported for `r min_prec_1817_location`. The only site with a noticeable positive anomaly was Lake Kusai (`r max_prec_1817`%).

Derived from the `r n_of_lakes` lakes were `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)` records, which we examined in this study. Of these records, `r n_of_layers_of$varve` were derived from total varve thickness measurements, while `r n_of_layers_of$light_layer` concerned each of light and dark sublayer thicknesses. According to information provided in the original publications, `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name) - n_no_climate` records reveal a clear association with some climate-related variable (@fig-varve-climate-relations). Of these, only `r n_neg` records revealed a negative relationship with the driving climate-related variable (i.e., the higher the value of the variable, the thicker the layer), whereas the remaining records showed a positive relationship. The most common climate-related variable influencing the records was temperature (n = `r n_temp`), followed by precipitation (n = `r n_prec`), hydrological extremes (n = `r n_hyd_x`), and wind strength (n = `r n_wind`). Although for majority of the records (n = `r n_summer`), summer was the most important season controlling the thicknesses, some records revealed a clearer association with other seasons (`r n_winter` with winter, `r n_spring` with spring, and `r n_autumn` with autumn). In the case of `r n_na` records revealing relationship with climate-related variable, none of the seasons played a dominant role.

"The records differed markedly in terms of maximum amplitude of fluctuations, average thicknesses, and overall variability (@fig-thicknesses). In the records from Lake Kuninkaisenlampi, the thicknesses in the section between 1785 and 1794 CE were derived from interpolation (shown as a translucent red rectangle in @fig-thicknesses). Therefore, we excluded this interval from further analyses. Altogether, we found `r n_of_zeros` thickness values equal to zero. Excluding zeros, the minimum values range from `r min(min_min_thick$min_thick)` mm to `r max(min_min_thick$min_thick)` mm. Even more pronounced differences were found for median thicknesses (ranging from `r min(med_med_thick$med_thick)` mm to `r max(med_med_thick$med_thick)`mm), and especially for maximum thicknesses (ranging from `r min(max_max_thick$max_thick)` mm to `r max(max_max_thick$max_thick)` mm). The noticeable difference in variability of the thicknesses is evident from the wide range of standard deviation values (`r round(min(sd_sd_thick$sd_thick), 2)` mm to `r round(max(sd_sd_thick$sd_thick), 2)` mm).

The criterion we used to select the optimal $k$ in calculating $MED$ (@eq-med) and $MAD$ (@eq-mad) yielded variable results that ranged from the minimum to maximum pre-selected values of $k$ (`r min(full_ds_k$k)` and `r max(full_ds_k$k)`, respectively). Accordingly, window sizes used in the calculations varied from `r min(full_ds_k$window_size)` to `r max(full_ds_k$window_size)` (specific window sizes used are provided in parentheses next to the record labels in @fig-thicknesses). We observed a noticeable difference in the number of outliers detected depending on the selection of the $z$ parameter in @eq-tdv (@fig-n-of-out). The median number of negative anomalies for various $z$ values were as follows: `r n_neg_out$median_n[1]` ($z$=`r n_neg_out$z[1]`), `r n_neg_out$median_n[2]` ($z$=`r n_neg_out$z[2]`), and `r n_neg_out$median_n[3]` ($z$=`r n_neg_out$z[3]`). Similarly, for positive anomalies, the median number of outliers detected varied from `r n_pos_out$median_n[1]` ($z$=`r n_pos_out$z[1]`), through `r n_pos_out$median_n[2]` ($z$=`r n_pos_out$z[2]`), to `r n_pos_out$median_n[3]` ($z$=`r n_pos_out$z[3]`). The solution closest to the desired outcome, with the majority of records containing not more than 5% anomalous observations, was achieved with $z$ = `r n_neg_out$z[3]` for identifying negative extremes and $z$ = `r n_pos_out$z[3]` for identifying positive extremes.

Within the time range 1816±7 CE, no anomalies were found in `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)-length(yws_scales)`records, a single anomaly was found in`r sum(yws_scales == 1)` records, and more than one anomaly was identified in `r sum(yws_scales > 1)` records (@fig-scaled-an). The scaled magnitude of the anomaly at 1816±7 CE was exceptional compared to the remaining anomalies in records such as Ayr Lake - varve, Chala - light layer, Donard - varve, Green Lake - varve, Holzmaar - varve, Iceberg Lake_1 - varve, Nar Gölü - light layer, Nautajärvi - dark layer, Oeschinen - varve, Żabińskie - dark layer (@fig-scaled-an).

## Discussion

Understanding the relationships between varve/varve-sublayer thickness anomalies and climate perturbations following the 1815 CE Tambora eruption is inherently difficult. With no direct proxy currently available for identifying the event in the records, we must rely solely on correlating changes in chronologically imperfect time-series with this yearly-scale event. Notwithstanding this difficulty, we argue that it should still be possible to reasonably assess the likelihood of a YWS imprint in the records by relying on our robust identification of thickness anomalies (@fig-scaled-an), combined with knowledge of the site-specific relationship between climate and layer thicknesses (@fig-varve-climate-relations), and the up-to-date understanding of climate anomalies during YWS (@fig-climate-an). Accordingly, based on our results, we distinguished four categories of records that differ in their potential to contain an imprint of YWS (@fig-scaled-an). These are as follows: (i) YWS imprint unlikely A; (ii) YWS imprint unlikely B; (iii) YWS imprint questionable; and (iv) YWS imprint likely. Below, we characterize each category and explain in detail how the categorization was performed.

### YWS imprint unlikely A

The first category (YWS imprint unlikely A), comprises all the `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)-length(yws_scales)` records where no anomalies were detected within the time range of 1816±7 years (plots with red background in @fig-scaled-an). For the majority of records in this category, the absence of anomalies can likely be attributed to the small magnitude of the climate anomaly or the site-specific relationships between varve-formation processes and climate. For example, according to EKF400v2, precipitation during YWS was close to the long-term average, and temperature change did not significantly exceed 1°C for the locations of Blue Lake, C2, Chevalier, Elk Lake, and Hvítárvatn (@fig-climate-an). In Big Round Lake - varve, Lagoon Etoliko - light layer, Lehmilampi - varve, Montcortès - light layer, Nautajärvi - light layer, and Nar Gölü - dark layer, although the climate anomaly was more noticeable, either the climate variable or the season during which the anomaly occurred was not attributed as having a dominant influence on the thickness variations (@fig-climate-an and @fig-varve-climate-relations).  

There are only two records in the first category where an anomaly could have been expected: Ogac - light layer and Upper Sopper - dark layer. In both cases, summer temperatures, which are the most significant predictors of layer thicknesses (@fig-varve-climate-relations), declined by more than 1.5°C (@fig-climate-an). One possible explanation for the lack of a significant thickness anomaly in these records is that Ogac and Upper Sopper are located in a region likely characterized by exceptionally large year-to-year temperature fluctuations (ref. Olonscheck et al., 2021). Therefore, while a temperature change of 1.5°C may seem noticeable on a global scale, it may not have been as significant regionally.

### YWS imprint unlikely B

In the second category (YWS imprint unlikely B), there are twelve records showing anomalies in the period 1816±7 that should not be present if the climate shift during YWS was the main driver controlling layer thicknesses and if the thickness-climate relationship was correctly identified in the original publications (plots with orange background in @fig-scaled-an). During YWS, summer temperatures were slightly lower for locations from which the following records were derived: Donard - varve, DV09 - varve, Lower Murray Lake - varve, and Sawtooth - varve (@fig-climate-an). Since all these records show a positive relationship with summer temperature (@fig-varve-climate-relations), a negative anomaly, if any, was expected. However, in each case, a positive anomaly is present. For the remaining records in this category, namely East Lake_1 - varve, East Lake_2 - varve, Green Lake - varve, Iceberg Lake_1 - varve, Iceberg Lake_2 - varve, Kusai - light layer, Plomo - varve, and Chala - light layer, climate anomalies relevant to the thicknesses were all minimal (@fig-climate-an), and thus should not be considered the sole explanatory factors for exceptionally thick or thin layers.  

We separated this category from 'YWS unlikely A' because we cannot completely exclude the possibility that there may exist more complex relationships between YWS and layer thicknesses, or that climate anomalies not considered as important may have influenced the records regardless. For instance, here we considered only seasonal averages, which, despite providing an important first-order approximation of past climate conditions, are not able to capture all climate variability that might have influenced sedimentation in lakes. Also, it is possible that the relationship between climate variables and the thickness has changed over time. Such a change was reported in the record from Lake Silvaplana, Switzerland, which revealed a positive relationship with temperature over the twentieth century and a negative one before (ref. Blass et al., 2007). However, any discussion of potential influences of factors that cannot be reliably reconstructed would inevitably remain speculative. Therefore, we argue that given the available data, it appears reasonable to consider the imprint of YWS in records of the second category as unlikely.  

Perhaps the most interesting record in the 'YWS imprint unlikely B' category is Chala - light layer, where one of the three anomalies found at 1816±7 was exceptionally large, even when considered on a multi-millennial timescale (ref. Wolff et al., 2011). Yet, NH summer precipitation, which is the strongest predictor of thicknesses in this case (@fig-varve-climate-relations), remained unchanged during the YWS period (@fig-climate-an). One could argue that climate reconstruction for Lake Chala is imprecise due to the large distance to the nearest available climate observation information (ref. Valler). However, another line of evidence suggests that precipitation was not markedly changed during the YWS period. Precipitation in central-east Africa is driven to a large extent by ENSO oscillation, with particularly wet NH summers corresponding to prominent La Niña events (ref. Wolff et al., 2011). Thus, any anomalously wet summers should be traceable in the ENSO index record, which apparently does not show any noticeable shifts around 1816 CE (ref. Li et al., 2013). Therefore, we assume that EKF400v2 is probably not exceedingly wrong in suggesting no noticeable NH summer precipitation anomaly for 1816 CE. Consequently, the prominent anomaly in the Chala - light layer record is most likely derived from processes not directly related to the climate impacts of the 1815 Tambora eruption, and its presence around 1816 CE is simply a coincidence. 

### YWS imprint questionable

The seven records that fall into the third category ('YWS imprint questionable'; plots with light-yellow background in @fig-scaled-an) reveal a complex relationship with climate, with no single variable clearly dominating the influence on thicknesses (@fig-varve-climate-relations). Although this complex relationship prevents a straightforward association of the thickness anomalies around YWS with the climatic impacts of the 1815 Tambora eruption, climate should still be considered a potentially important factor due to the noticeable climate anomaly around YWS found for each location from which the records were derived. For Lagoon Etoliko, there was a change in NH summer precipitation that reached almost 150% of the long-term average, whereas for all the remaining lakes, there was either a summer or winter temperature change of at least 1.5°C (@fig-climate-an).  
However complex the relationship between sedimentary proxies like varve thickness and climate may be, the influence of temperature and precipitation variations on lake sedimentary processes cannot be neglected. For instance, it is possible that the presence of thickness anomalies occurred in response to climate perturbations if varve/varve-sublayer thicknesses in the records from the third category responded in a threshold fashion to YWS. In such a scenario, noticeable changes in the records would result from high-magnitude YWS climate forcing, while less prominent climate fluctuations in more recent times, for which instrumental data is available and have been tested for climate-thickness relationships, were masked by other influences (ref. Randsalu-Wendrup, 2016).  

Despite it appearing more likely that records from the third category contain the imprint of YWS compared to records from the first two categories, caution is needed when associating the thickness anomalies with climate in this case. Lake sedimentation is typically influenced by multiple factors. For instance, in lakes with well-documented human impact during the YWS period, such as Lake Żabińskie in Poland, an anthropogenic trigger becomes at least as likely as climatic factors. Additionally, random processes unrelated to environmental disturbances, such as sediment redeposition due to slumping, could explain varve thickness anomalies (ref. Apolinarska et al., 2020). Therefore, without additional evidence enabling the association of thickness anomalies in the records from this category with climate perturbation, we consider the YWS imprint to be questionable.

### YWS imprint likely

The last category, 'YWS imprint likely,' comprises the five records for which we found anomalously thin or thick layers at 1816±7 CE, along with noticeable climate anomalies at the sites from which the records were derived. Additionally, for a record to be included in this category, the thickness anomalies had to correspond to the climate anomaly with which it revealed the strongest association. Two records, Kusai - dark layer and Kuninkaisenlampi - light layer, were included in this category conditionally and require some caution.    

A positive anomaly in the Kusai - dark layer record was identified as possibly related to YWS based on the results of a climate modeling study by Wegmann et al. (2014) that suggested the location of Lake Kusai experienced a positive summer wind anomaly during 1816 CE. We suggest caution in this case because the results of the climate modeling reveal high spatial variability of the anomalies around the location of Lake Kusai, and there is a lack of independent confirmation.  

In the case of Kuninkaisenlampi - light layer, caution is required because the thickness in the record is assumed to respond most readily to hydrological extremes for which we have no other proxy independent of thickness data. The record was included in the fourth category because Saarni et al. (2016ref) suggested that hydrological extremes are inversely related to winter temperature. Since winter temperature for the location of Lake Kuninkaisenlampi was higher by ~1.5°C than the long-term average, we consider it likely that negative thickness anomalies correspond to this warming. For the Kuninkaisenlampi - light layer record, an additional factor complicating the association of an anomaly with climate fluctuation following the 1815 CE Tambora eruption is the presence of several consecutive anomalies for the period 1816±7 CE. One possible explanation for the occurrence of consecutive anomalies is related to the hydrological memory of the catchment, which could allow a climatic anomaly to influence the hydrological behavior of a catchment for several years (de Lavenne et al. 2022). However, it remains unclear whether this or other factors are behind the multiple anomalies during the period in focus.  

For the remaining lakes in the fourth category, the relevant climate anomaly was derived directly from the output of EKF400v2. Because all the lakes from which these records were derived are located in or near Europe, where abundant observational information is available (ref Valler et al.), a high confidence in the reconstructed climate anomaly is expected. The thickness anomaly that likely corresponds to YWS in the Holzmaar - varve record has the largest scaled magnitude over the entire period considered (@fig-scaled-out). Although it is not conclusive from correlation with instrumental data which season drives the thicknesses the most, given the pronounced NH summer cooling (>2°C; @fig-climate-an) and the inverse relationship with temperature (@fig-varve-climate-relations), we assume that it was the warm season cooling that was behind the exceptional thickness of the varve, while the reconstructed winter warming had no clear impact on thicknesses.    

In the Nar Gölü - light layer record, there are three thickness anomalies in the period 1816±7 CE: two negative, which are both of small scaled magnitude, and one positive, which is large (@fig-scaled-out). Light layer thickness in the Nar Gölü record is positively related to spring precipitation (@fig-varve-climate-relations). Therefore, it is most likely that the large, positive thickness anomaly resulted from excessive spring precipitation (>120% of the long-term mean according to EKF400v2; data not shown) followed by an exceptionally wet summer (precipitation exceeded 200% of the long-term mean; @fig-climate-an). If this association of the positive anomaly with YWS is correct, then the origin of the negative anomalies must be explained by other factors.    

Oeschinen - varve record revealed two anomalies at 1816±7 CE: one positive, which is larger, and one negative, which is smaller (@fig-scaled-out). We assume that it is the positive thickness anomaly that recorded the climatic effects of the 1815 CE Tambora eruption. The most prominent climate anomaly during YWS reported for the location of Lake Oeschinen was NH summer cooling that exceeded 2.5°C (@fig-climate-an). However, as the varve thickness is primarily related to precipitation (@fig-varve-climate-relations), it is more likely that the YWS imprint is associated with the precipitation anomaly, which reached 120% of the long-term average (@fig-climate-an). It is well documented that the NH summer of 1816 CE was exceptionally wet in Switzerland, even if it was the number of days with precipitation rather than the total precipitation sum that differed markedly from average conditions (ref Brönnimann 2014).  

## Conclusions

In this study, we examined `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)` available varve and varve sub-layer thickness records covering the period from 1766 to 1866 CE to investigate the possible imprint of the prominent climate anomaly following the 1815 CE Tambora eruption, known as the 1816 year without a summer (YWS). We hypothesized that because YWS was one of the most globally prominent yearly-scale climatic shifts of recent centuries, and because varve thickness is a sensitive climate recorder, there would be thickness anomalies corresponding to YWS in many records. Contrary to our expectations, we found that, in most cases, the imprint is missing.

There are two main reasons behind the limited number of records containing the YWS signal. First, despite the climate anomaly being prominent on a global scale, many sites from which the records were derived experienced only limited shifts in temperature and precipitation. Thus, the climate forcing affecting lake sedimentation was likely too weak to cause thickness anomalies. In a few other cases, the climate forcing was noticeable. However, either the season revealing the anomaly or the climate variable that noticeably departed from the long-term mean were not the primary drivers of layer thicknesses as recognized in the original studies. The lack of thickness anomalies in these cases shows that varve thicknesses are poor recorders of even prominent climate anomalies if the climatic conditions most relevant to varve-formation processes at a given site remain stable. Because of this, globally correlated varve thickness anomalies should probably not be expected, even in the case of the most prominent Holocene volcanic winters.

Notwithstanding the above, the likely presence of the YWS imprint in the five time series corroborates the ability of varve thicknesses to record yearly-scale climate anomalies. In fact, among lakes that experienced a noticeable climate anomaly occurring during the season and affecting the climate variable that clearly correlates with thicknesses, only two lacked thickness anomalies. For several other records with thickness anomalies corresponding to YWS, the original publications did not identify the dominant climate forcing driving the thicknesses, and thus we did not consider them to contain the imprint of the volcanic winter to avoid overly speculative associations. However, it remains likely that at least for some of these records, there was a relationship between climate and thickness anomalies. Regardless, the five time series with the assumed record of YWS enable us to conclude that among other drivers, yearly-scale climate anomalies should be considered a likely factor behind event-like changes in varve thickness records.

We argue that future studies of volcanic winter impacts on lake environments should consider examining records containing the likely imprint of YWS using a multi-proxy approach. This will enable more detailed inferences of lake ecosystem alterations associated with these events. However, perhaps the most challenging task for future studies focusing on volcanic winter records in lake archives is finding a proxy independent of tephra that would allow for a more direct association of changes in sediment records with volcanic winters. Otherwise, in the absence of tephra, the results will always suffer from chronological imperfections of sediment records, making precise correlation with short-term climatic events difficult or even impossible on multicentennial and longer timescales.
