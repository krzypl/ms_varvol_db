# Title: Imprint of the 1816 year without a summer in varve thickness records from lake sediment archives 

Authors: Pleskot Krzysztof, Zolitschka Bernd 

Affiliation: 

## Abstract: 

Keywords: 1815 Tambora eruption, lake sediments, varve thickness, climate event

## 1. Introduction: 

tutaj dodac cytowanie siebie wskazujac na ograniczony wplyw na lake environment nawet ekstremalnych zdarzen, ktore zaburzaja system takich jak ekstremalne zalewy morskie jezior przybrzeznych.

Globaly, the climate anomaly following the 1815 Tambora eruption was exceptional at least in the last 300 years (refNeukom et al. 2019).

-   Relationship between varve thickness and climate – insights from monitoring studies and sediment records; underlie complexities, start from former belive that we can correlate varve records globally 

-   sensitivity to short-term (annual scale) climate perturbation need yet to be confirmed 

-   YWS as perfect candidate to test relationship between varve thickness and climate events – recent = small chronological uncertainty, covered by relatively large number of records; well documented = amplitude of climate change well understood; single reports of possible relationship between changes in sediment record and volcanic winters 

-   Aim: To identify noticeable varve thickness anomalies in available varve thickness records around 1816, and to evaluate their possible links to YWS climate event. 

## 2. Methods 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
full_ds <- read_csv("data/full_ds.csv") %>% 
  filter(age_CE >= 1766 & age_CE <= 1866)

full_ds_distinct <- full_ds %>% 
  group_by(layer) %>% 
  distinct(lake_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

```

In this study, we relied on published varve thickness records covering the period from 1766 to 1866 CE. We focused on a 101-year-long period centered on 1816 CE, aiming to capture the prominence of anomalies potentially corresponding to YWS at a centennial scale. Only records with yearly resolution and continuity for the period in focus were included in the study. To obtain the relevant data, we searched through the following data repositories: (i) VARDA (ref. Ramisch), (ii) World Data Service for Paleoclimatology (WDS-Paleo) at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (ref. Gross), and (iii) PANGAEA (ref. Felden). Additionally, we performed a literature search for records not available in public data repositories and asked corresponding authors to make their data available for this study. If data on varve sublayer thickness was available, we used it in the analysis instead of total varve thickness values. These sublayers were assigned to two classes: “light layer” and “dark layer”. Note that these classes are descriptive and include sediments of various compositions. For four records, high-quality data was available only for a single class of varve sublayer. @tbl-list-of-records lists all the `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)` records that were examined in this study along with relevant references.

To identify the climate variable and season that most influence the varve or varve sublayer thicknesses in a given record, we examined the relevant information in the original publications. We described each record, distinguishing positive and negative relationships for one of the four seasons if such a relationship was reported by the authors. If the authors provided no information on the relationship, or if the relationship was reported to be weak, we classified these records as uncertain. Similarly, if no information was available on which season influenced varve thicknesses the most, or if the relationship with the seasons was uncertain, the designation was made as "NA".

Climate anomalies during the peak of the YWS for the location of the lakes were obtained from the global atmospheric paleo-reanalysis EKF400v2, which provides estimates of several climate variables with monthly resolution for the period of 1600-2005 CE (ref Valler). The paleo-reanalysis relies on a data assimilation approach that infers past climate states from both climate model simulations and observational information (documentary, instrumental, and proxy sources). Based on the EKF400v2 data, we calculated temperature anomalies for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer (June, July, August) of 1816 CE and NH winter (December, January, February) of 1816/1817 CE with respect to the 1766-1866 means. The same calculations were performed for precipitation anomalies. We focused on NH summer and winter anomalies to investigate the potential climatic effects of the 1815 CE Tambora eruption on both warm and cold seasons in both the northern and southern hemispheres. EKF400v2 performs well in describing past annual-scale climate anomalies (ref Valler), which justifies its use in this study. However, it is important to note that the precision of the reconstruction can vary depending on the proximity of the grid cell to the nearest observational information and the precision of the information itself. For the period in focus, high density and variability of information are available mainly for Europe and North America, while for most other regions, there is a shortage of information (ref Valler). This is particularly true for Africa.

To identify noticeable anomalies in varve thickness data, we first estimated trends using a running median:   
$$
MED_i =median\{x(i)\}_{i=i-k}^{i+k}
$${#eq-med}   
where $x(i)$ is the varve thickness at time $i$, and then calculated time-dependent variability in the records using a running median absolute distance:   
$$
MAD_i = median\{|x(j) - median\{x(i)\}_{i=i-k}^{i+k}|\}_{j=i-k}^{i+k}
$${#eq-mad} 
The smoothing parameter $k$, which controls width of the window in the calculations, was selected separately for each record from a range of 6 to 14 to minimize the cross-validation criterion $C_1$ prsented by Zheng and Yang (ref1998):  
$$
C_1 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n|x(i)-median\{x(j)\}_{j=i-k}^{i+k}|
$${#eq-c1}    
Limiting $k$ to the range $[6,14]$, which results in a window width of 13 to 29 years (window width = $2k + 1$), aims to avoid solutions that use either overly large or exceedingly small $k$ values. If no pre-selection is made, an erroneous $k$ an be suggested by the $C_1$ criterion, as it is not completely resistant to autocorrelation typically occurring in time series (Mudelsee_ref). We used $MED$ and $MAD$ because these are robust estimators that are not biased by extremes. Since methods relying on moving windows truncate the original records at both ends, we used records longer than 101 years as input. This approach eliminated the need to extrapolate the resulting records to obtain the desired time range of 1766-1866 CE. We consider the thickness of a layer to be anomalously large or small if it exceeds the threshold defined by
$$
MED + MAD\times z$
$${#eq-tdv}  
where $z$ is a threshold detection value. Following Besonen et al. (ref2008) we examined various values of $z$. For positive anomalies, we tested zz values of 2, 3.5, and 5, while for negative anomalies, we used values of 1, 1.75, and 2.5. Lower values of $z$ were examined to detect negative extremes, considering the hard boundary at 0 mm. The final decision on selecting $z$ for positive and negative anomalies was based on evaluating the number of identified anomalies. Our aim was to identify solutions where anomalies constitute no more than 5% of all observations. For thicknesses that exceeded upper or lower thresholds, we calculated the magnitude of the anomaly considering sample-specific $MAD$:  
$$
S_m = \frac{x(i)-MED}{MAD}
$${#eq-sm}    
As a first approximation, we considered an anomaly to be potentially related to the YWS if it occurred around 1816 ± 7 years. We applied the same uncertainty level to all records because, in most cases, chronological uncertainty was not evaluated. The ±7-year range corresponds to a chronological uncertainty of 3.5% relative to the time of the YWS. This slightly exceeds the ±2% suggested by Ojala et al. (ref2012) as a realistic error for most varve chronologies. However, we decided to use a relatively long time-frame to avoid prematurely excluding anomalies around the YWS that may arise from records potentially suffering from lower chronological precision.

The records examined in this study come from `r n_of_lakes` lakes (@tbl-list-of-records). Most of the lakes are located in North America (n = `r n_continents$n[which(n_continents$continent == "North America")]`) and Europe (n = `r n_continents$n[which(n_continents$continent == "Europe")]`), but our dataset includes lakes from every continent except Australia and Antarctica (@fig-maps). The EKF400v2 reconstruction shows variable climate anomalies for the location of the lakes during NH summer 1816 and winter 1816/1817. The temperature during the summer of 1816 was noticeably lower than the average from 1766 to 1866 for most of the Earth's land surface, including the majority of the lake locations. For `r words(n_of_prominent_neg_temp_1816)` sites, the cooling exceeded 1°C reaching minimum of $\Delta$ `r round(min_temp_1816, 1)`°C at `r as.character(min_temp_1816_location)`. Warming was reported only for `r words(n_of_pos_temp_1816)` sites, but in neither case did it markedly exceed 0.5°C. During NH winter of 1816/1817 CE, more of the Earth's land surface experienced warming compared to NH summer of 1816 CE, and more lake locations showed positive temperature anomalies. However, the number of sites experiencing cooling prevailed (n = `r n_of_neg_temp_1817`). The cooling was the most pronounced for the lakes located in Arctic Canada, where it exceeded 2°C reaching a minimum of $\Delta$ `r round(min_temp_1817, 1)` °C at `r as.character(min_temp_1817_location)`. Positive anomalies exceeded 1°C at `r words(n_of_prominent_pos_temp_1817)` locations reaching a maximum of $\Delta$ `r round(max_temp_1817, 1)`°C at Lake `r as.character(max_temp_1817_location)`.

Spatial manifestation of precipitation anomalies for NH summer 1816 CE is less uniform than this of temperature anomalies. We found that exactly half of the sites (n = `r n_of_neg_prec_1816`) experienced less precipitation than the 1766-1866 CE average. Departures from the mean were mostly small (\<25%) but at Nar Gölü, there was more than twice as much precipitation as expected from the long-term mean (`r max_prec_1816`%). During NH winter 1816/1817 CE, precepitation anomalies also varied spatially. For most of the the lake locations (n = `r n_of_neg_prec_1817`), it was drier than average with the minimum of `r min_prec_1817`% of the average reported for `r min_prec_1817_location`. The only site with a noticeable positive anomaly was Lake Kusai (`r max_prec_1817`%).

Derived from the `r n_of_lakes` lakes were `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)` records, which we examined in this study. Of these records, `r n_of_layers_of$varve` were derived from total varve thickness measurements, while `r n_of_layers_of$light_layer` concerned each of light and dark sublayer thicknesses. According to information provided in the original publications, `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name) - n_no_climate` records reveal a clear association with some climate-related variable (@fig-varve-climate-relations). Of these, only `r n_neg` records revealed a negative relationship with the driving climate-related variable (i.e., the higher the value of the variable, the thicker the layer), whereas the remaining records showed a positive relationship. The most common climate-related variable influencing the records was temperature (n = `r n_temp`), followed by precipitation (n = `r n_prec`), hydrological extremes (n = `r n_hyd_x`), and wind strength (n = `r n_wind`). Although for majority of the records (n = `r n_summer`), summer was the most important season controlling the thicknesses, some records revealed a clearer association with other seasons (`r n_winter` with winter, `r n_spring` with spring, and `r n_autumn` with autumn). In the case of `r n_na` records revealing relationship with climate-related variable, none of the seasons played a dominant role.

"The records differed markedly in terms of maximum amplitude of fluctuations, average thicknesses, and overall variability (@fig-thicknesses). In the records from Lake Kuninkaisenlampi, the thicknesses in the section between 1785 and 1794 CE were derived from interpolation (shown as a translucent red rectangle in @fig-thicknesses). Therefore, we excluded this interval from further analyses. Altogether, we found `r n_of_zeros` thickness values equal to zero. Excluding zeros, the minimum values range from `r min(min_min_thick$min_thick)` mm to `r max(min_min_thick$min_thick)` mm. Even more pronounced differences were found for median thicknesses (ranging from `r min(med_med_thick$med_thick)` mm to `r max(med_med_thick$med_thick)`mm), and especially for maximum thicknesses (ranging from `r min(max_max_thick$max_thick)` mm to `r max(max_max_thick$max_thick)` mm). The noticeable difference in variability of the thicknesses is evident from the wide range of standard deviation values (`r round(min(sd_sd_thick$sd_thick), 2)` mm to `r round(max(sd_sd_thick$sd_thick), 2)` mm).

The criterion we used to select the optimal $k$ in calculating $MED$ (@eq-med) and $MAD$ (@eq-mad) yielded variable results that ranged from the minimum to maximum pre-selected values of $k$ (`r min(full_ds_k$k)` and `r max(full_ds_k$k)`, respectively). Accordingly, window sizes used in the calculations varied from `r min(full_ds_k$window_size)` to `r max(full_ds_k$window_size)` (specific window sizes used are provided in parentheses next to the record labels in @fig-thicknesses). We observed a noticeable difference in the number of outliers detected depending on the selection of the $z$ parameter (@eq-tdv). The median number of negative anomalies for various $z$ values were as follows: `r n_neg_out$median_n[1]` ($z$=`r n_neg_out$z[1]`), `r n_neg_out$median_n[2]` ($z$=`r n_neg_out$z[2]`), and `r n_neg_out$median_n[3]` ($z$=`r n_neg_out$z[3]`). Similarly, for positive anomalies, the median number of outliers detected varied from `r n_pos_out$median_n[1]` ($z$=`r n_pos_out$z[1]`), through `r n_pos_out$median_n[2]` ($z$=`r n_pos_out$z[2]`), to `r n_pos_out$median_n[3]` ($z$=`r n_pos_out$z[3]`). The solution closest to the desired outcome, with the majority of records containing not more than 5% anomalous observations, was achieved with $z$ = `r n_neg_out$z[3]` for identifying negative extremes and $z$ = `r n_pos_out$z[3]` for identifying positive extremes.

In the selected solution, the total number of identified outliers varied from `r min(tot_scales_out)` to `r max(tot_scales_out)`. For `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)-length(neg_scales_out)` records, there was no negative anomaly, whereas a positive anomaly was absent in `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)-length(pos_scales_out)` records. The maximum numbers of negative and positive anomalies were `r max(neg_scales_out)` and `r max(pos_scales_out)`, respectively. Within the time range 1816±7 CE, no anomalies were found in `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)-length(yws_scales)`records, a single anomaly was found in`r sum(yws_scales == 1)`records, and more than one anomaly was identified in `r sum(yws_scales > 1)` records.

## Discussion

Understanding relationships between thickness anomalies and climate perturbation following the 1815 Tambora eruption is inherently difficult as it relies solely on correlating changes in chronologically imperfect records with short-lasting historical event of which spatial manifestation remains only partly understood. Notwithstandind this difficulty, we claim it is still possible to reasonably assess likelyness of YWS imprint in the records relying on our robust identification of thickness anomalies combined with knowlage on site-specific relationship between climate and leyer thickness and up-to-date understanding of climate anomalies during YWS. Accordingly, relying on the results we distinguished four categories of records that differ in their potential of containing imprint of YWS. These are as follows (from the least to the most likely): (i) YWS imprint unlikely A; (ii) YWS imprint unlikely B; (iii) YWS imprint questionable; and (iv) YWS imprint likely. Below we characterize each category and explain how the categorization was performed in detail.

### YWS imprint unlikely A

The first category (YWS imprint unlikely A), comprises all the `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)-length(yws_scales)` records that have no anomalies within the time-range of 1816±7. For majority of the records from this category the lack of anomalies was expected. In several cases (Blue Lake - varve, C2 - varve, Chevalier - varve, Elk lake - varve, Hvítárvatn_1 - varve, and Hvítárvatn_2 - varve) EKF400v2 suggests only slight climate anomalies, with precipitation close to long term average and temperature change not significantly exceeding 1stC. In few other cases (Big Round Lake - varve, Lagoon Etoliko - light layer, Lehmilampi - varve, Montcortès - light layer, Nautajärvi - light layer, and Nar Gölü - dark layer), even tough the climate anomaly was more noticeable, either the climate variable or the season when this anomaly occurred were not the ones that influences the thicknesses the most at particular locations. Consequently, lack of anomaly does not undermine climate sensitivity of these records, too. The only two records from the first category for which anomaly could have been expected are Ogac - ligth layer and Upper Sopper - dark layer. In both cases, summer temperature felt for more than 1.5stC, while being the most important predictor of the layer thicknesses. One possible explanation for the lack of significant thickness anomaly in these records is that Ogac and Upper Sopper are located in the region likely characterized by exceptionally large year-to-year temperature fluctuations (ref Olonscheck et al 2021). Thus, even tough the tempearature change of 1.5stC appears noticeable when considered globally, it might have been not so significant regionally.

### YWS imprint unlikely B

In the second category (YWS imprint unlikely B), there are twelve records showing anomalies in the period 1816±7 that should not be present if climate shifts at YWS were the main driver controlling the layer thicknesses and thickness-climate relationship was correctly identified. During YWS, summer temperatures were slightly lower for locations from Donard - varve, DV09 - varve, Lower Murray Lake - varve, and Sawtooth - varve records were derived. Consequently, a negative anomaly, if any, was expected since all these records show a positive relationship with summer temperature (ref, ref, ref, ref). However, what is present in each case is a positive anomaly.\
For the remaining records in this category, i.e., East Lake_1 - varve, East Lake_2 - varve, Green Lake - varve, Iceberg Lake_1 - varve, Iceberg Lake_2 - varve, Kusai - light layer, Plomo - varve, and Chala - light layer, climate anomalies relevant to the thicknesses were all minute (Fig.X), and thus should not be considered the sole explaining drivers of excepttionally thick or thin layers. Perhaps, the most interesting record falling to this category is Chala - light layer for which one of the three anomalies found at 1816±7 was exceptionally large even if considered in multi-millenial time scale (ref). Yet, NH summer precipitaion, that is the strongest predictor of the thicknesess in this case (ref), remained unchanged for the time of YWS. One can argue that climate reconstruction for Lake Chala is not precise due to the large distance to the nearest available climate observation information (ref). However, there is another line of evidence suggesting precipitation was not markedly changed at the time of YWS. Precipitation in central-east Africa is driven to large extent by ENSO oscilation with particularly wet NH summers corresponding to prominent La nina events. Thus any anomalously wet summers should be tracable in ENSO index record that apparently does not show any noticeable shifts around 1816 CE (ref). Therefore, we assume that the EKF400v2 is probably not exceedingly wrong suggesting no noticeable NH summer precipitation anomaly for 1816 CE. Consequently, the prominent anomaly in Chala - light layer record is most likely derived from processes not directly related to climate impacts on the climate of the 1815 Tambora eruption, and its presence around 1816 CE is a simple coincidence. We separated this category from "YWS unlikely A" because we cannot completely exclude that there exist in some cases more complex relationship between YWS and layer thicknesses or that climate anomalies not considered as important influenced the records anyway. Here, we considered only seasonal avarages that despite providing important first order approximation of how climate looked liked in the past, are not able to capture all climate variability that might have infulenced sedimentation in lakes. For instance, for most of the locations we know nothing about monthly maxima and minima during YWS, while they could have played important role in driving thicknesses at least in some cases. However, the existence of such relationships remain inevitably speculative. Therefore, we argue that given the available data it appears reasonable to consider the imprint YWS in records of the second category as unlikely.

### YWS imprint questionable

The seven records that fall into the third category ("YWS imprint questionable"; Ayr Lake - varve, Kuninkaisenlampi - dark layer, Lagoon Etoliko - dark layer, Nautajärvi - dark layer, Ogac - dark layer, Żabińskie - dark layer, and Żabińskie - light layer) reveal a complex relationship with climate, with no single variable clearly dominating the influence on thicknesses (Fig.X). Although this complex relationship prevents a straightforward association of the thickness anomalies around YWS with the climatic impacts of the 1815 Tambora eruption, one should consider climate as a potentially important factor due to the noticeable climate anomaly around YWS found for each location from which the records were derived. For Lagoon Etoliko, it was a change in summer precipitation that reached almost 150% of the long-term average, whereas for all the remaining lakes, it was either summer or winter temperature change of at least 1.5°C. It is generally well established that climate is a crucial driver of lake sedimentary processes, even if the relationship between sedimentary proxies, like varve thickness, and climate appear complex. For instance, it remains possible that sedimentation in lakes from the third category responded in a threshold fashion to YWS. In such scenario, noticeable change in the records could have occurred in response to high-magnitude YWS climate forcing while less prominent climate fluctuations in more recent times, for which instrumental data is available, and that were tested for climate-thickness relationship, were masked by other influences (Randsalu-Wendrupref).\
However, association of thickness anomalies with climate requires caution as lake sedimentation is usually controlled by multiple factors. In particular, in the case of lakes with well-documented human impact during the period of YWS, like Lake Żabińskie, Poland, an anthropogenic trigger becomes at least equally likely as climatic. Additionally, some random processes not related to environmental disturbance, like sediment slumping, could explain varve thickness anomalies. Therefore, without additional evidence enabling the association of thickness anomalies in the records from this category with climate perturbation, we assume that the YWS imprint should be considered questionable.

### YWS imprint likely

The last category, "YWS imprint likely", comprises the five records for which we found anomalously thin or thick layers at 1816±7 along with noticeable climate anomaly for the sites from which the records were derived. Additionally, for the record to be included in this category the thickness anomalies had to correspond to climate anomaly to which it reveal strongest association (e.g. if the thickness reveals positive relationship with summer temperature, the consistet change would be an exceptionally thin layer corresponding to an exceptionally cold summer). Two records, Kusai - dark leyer and Kuninkaisenlampi - light layer, were included to this category conditionally and requires more caution. Inclusion of Kusai - dark leyer relied on results of climate modelling study of Wegmann et al. (2014ref) that suggested the location of Lake Kusai experienced positive summer wind anomaly during 1816 CE explaining the positive thickness anomally in the record. We suggest caution in this case because the results of climate modeling lack independent confirmation in observation information. In the case of Kuninkaisenlampi - light layer caution is required because thickness in the record is assumed to respond most readily to hydrological extremes for which we have no other proxy independent of thicknesses data themselves. The record was included in the fourth category because Saarni et al. (2016ref) suggested that the hydrological extremes are inversely related to winter temperature. Since winter temperature for the location of Lake Kuninkaisenlampi was higher of \~1.5stC than long-term average, we consider it likely that negative thickness anomalies correspond to this warming. For Kuninkaisenlampi - light layer record the additional factor that complicates association of an anomaly with climate fluctuation following the 1815 Tambora eruption is that it reveals not one, but several consecutive anomalies for the period 1816±7. One possible explanation for the occurence of the consecutive anomalies is that it is related to hydrological memory of the catchment that make it possible for climatic anomaly to influence hydrological behavior of a catchment for several years (ref de Lavenne et al. 2022). However, it remains unclear whether this or other factors stays behind the multiple anomalies during the priod in focus.

For the remaining lakes from fourth category, the relevant climate anomaly was derived directly from the output of EKF400v2 (Fig.X). Because all the lakes from which these records were derived are located in or close to Europe, for which abundant observation information is available, the high confidence of reconstructed climate anomaly is expected. The thickness anomaly that likely corresponds to YWS in Holzmaar - varve record has the largest scaled magnitude over the entire period considered. Although it is not conclusive from correlation with instrumental data which season drives the thicknesses the most, given the pronounced NH summer cooling (\>2stC) and inverse relationship with temperature, we assume that it was the warm season cooling that stayed behind the exceptional thickness of the varve, while the reconstructed winter warming had no clear impacts on thicknesses. In Nar Gölü - light layer record there are three thickness anomalies in the period 1816±7, two negative, which are both of small scaled magnitude and one positive which is large. Light layer thickness in Nar Gölü record is positively related to spring precipitation. Therefore, it is most likely that the large, positive thickness anomaly resulted from excessive spring precipitation (\>120% of long-term mean; data not showed) followed by exceptionally wet summer (precipitation exceeded 200% long-term mean). If this association of the positive anomaly with YWS is correct, the the origin of negative anomalies have to be explained by other factors. Oeschinen - varve record revealed two anomalies at 1816±7, one positive, which is larger, and one negative, which is smaller. We assume that this is the positive thickness anomaly that recorded climatic effects of the 1815 Tambora eruption. The most prominent climate anomaly during YWS reported for the location of Lake Oeschinen was NH summer cooling that exceeded 2.5stC. However, as the varve thickness is positively related primarily to precipitation, it remains more likely that the YWS imprint is associated more with precipitation anomaly which reached 120% of long-term average. It is well documented that NH summer of 1816 CE was exceptionally wet in Switzerland, even if it was rather number of days with precipitation than the total precipitation sum that differed markedly from average conditions (ref Brönnimann2014).

## Conclusions

In this study we examined `r length(full_ds_distinct$lake_name)` available varve and varve sub-layer thickness records covering the period 1766-1866 CE to investigate the possible imprint of the prominent climate anomaly following the 1815 Tambora eruption, known as the 1816 year without a summer (YWS). We hypothesized that because YWS was one of the most globally prominent yearly-scale climatic shifts of recent centuries, and because varve thickness is a sensitive climate recorder, there would be thickness anomalies corresponding to YWS in many records. Contrary to our expectations, we found that, in most cases, the imprint is missing.

There are two main reasons behind the limited number of records containing the YWS signal. First, despite the climate anomaly being prominent on a global scale, many sites from which the records were derived experienced only limited shifts in temperature and precipitation. Thus, the climate forcing affecting lake sedimentation was likely too weak to cause thickness anomalies. In a few other cases, the climate forcing was noticeable. However, either the season revealing the anomaly or the climate variable that noticeably departed from the long-term mean were not recognized as primary drivers of layer thicknesses in the original studies. The lack of thickness anomalies in these cases shows that varve thicknesses are poor recorders even of prominent climate anomalies if the climatic conditions most relevant to varve-formation processes at a given site remain stable. Because of this, globally correlated varve thickness anomalies should probably not be expected even in the case of a prominent volcanic winters.

Notwithstanding the above, the likely presence of YWS imprint in the five time series corroborates the ability of varve thicknesses to record yearly-scale climate anomalies. In fact, among lakes that experienced a noticeable climate anomaly occurring during the season and affecting the climate variable that clearly correlates with thicknesses, only two lacked thickness anomalies. For several other records with thickness anomalies corresponding to YWS, the original publications did not identify the dominant climate forcing driving the thicknesses, and thus we did not consider them to contain the imprint of the volcanic winter to avoid overly speculative associations. However, it remains likely that at least for some of these records, there was a relationship between climate and thickness anomalies. Regardless of this, the five time series with the assumed record of YWS enable us to conclude that among other drivers, yearly-scale climate anomalies should be considered a likely factor behind event-like changes in varve thickness records.

We argue that future studies of volcanic winter impacts on lake environments should consider examining records containing the likely imprint of YWS using a multi-proxy approach. This will enable more detailed inferences of lake ecosystem alterations associated with these events. However, perhaps the most challenging task for future studies focusing on volcanic winter records in lake archives is finding a proxy independent of tephra that would allow for a more direct association of changes in sediment records with volcanic winters. Otherwise, in the absence of tephra, the results will always suffer from chronological imperfections in sediment records, making precise correlation with short-term climatic events difficult on multicentennial timescales and largely impossible on longer timescales.
